A classic Top Gear drag race, Veyron and McLaren F1...﻿
That start makes ZERO sense! Bugatti 0-60 2.4. MF1 0-60 3.2. So how is it the car with NO launch control and almost a second slower to 60 MPH had the Bugatti of the line? Bugatti should have had the F1 the entire race except maybe 0-30 MPH or something.﻿
